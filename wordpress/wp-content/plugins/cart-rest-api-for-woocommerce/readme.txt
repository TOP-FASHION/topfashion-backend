A REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce that’s Easy and Powerful.

== Description ==

Building a headless store with the current WooCommerce REST API is kind of great, except, it’s missing one side of a store. The front side. 👕

See when your building a headless store, you want the ability to display your products so your customers can add them to the cart, 🛒 without the authentication roadblocks. 🔓 No need to force customers to register first. 🖊

So when you request to show your products in your app. Look! Your products are showing! 😀

But when your building a headless store with WooCommerce’s REST API, your only options are for the backend, not the frontend. 😭

It’s hard to build a store that way.

Now there’s [CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart). With CoCart you can build your headless store with the right REST API, for the frontend.

So if you want to display products by a category, go ahead, you can do it. 👍 All requests can be made in any code language and everything is completely customizable from the parameters, filters and action hooks.

So now building a headless WooCommerce store really is possible, only a whole lot easier.

CoCart. The fastest and easiest way to building headless WooCommerce stores.

= Credits =

This plugin is created by [Sébastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

You will first need WooCommerce v3.6 or higher installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation. That’s it!

= Who should use CoCart? =

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

= Does it work with any of the official WooCommerce libraries? =

Only if you request your customers to be logged in first. This is because all the official libraries require authentication which the cart does not require.
