Hosted services for WooCommerce including automated tax calculation, shipping label printing, and smoother payment setup.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Services makes basic eCommerce features like shipping more reliable by taking the burden off of your site’s infrastructure.

With WooCommerce Services, critical services are hosted on Automattic’s best-in-class infrastructure, rather than relying on your store’s hosting. That means your store will be more stable and faster.

To use the features, simply install this plugin and activate the ones you want directly in your dashboard. As we add more services, you’ll see more features available directly in WooCommerce - making setup simpler.

= Print shipping labels for USPS at a discounted rate =
Give customers lower rates on their shipping. Create ready-to-print shipping labels for USPS directly in WooCommerce and take advantage of our special discount rate.

= Collect accurate taxes at checkout =
We've got taxes for you - no need to enter tax rates manually.

= Be ready to accept payments instantly =
Have a Stripe account created on your behalf or accept PayPal Checkout payments without having to setup an account.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Install and activate WooCommerce if you haven't already done so
1. Install, activate and connect Jetpack if you haven't already done so
1. Want to buy shipping labels? First, add your credit card to https://wordpress.com/me/purchases/billing and then print labels for orders right from the Edit Order page
