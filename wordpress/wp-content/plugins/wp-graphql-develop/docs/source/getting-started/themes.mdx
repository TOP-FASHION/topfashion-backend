import GraphiQL from '../../src/components/GraphiQL'

Themes are a core tenant in every WordPress site. WPGraphQL exposes native ways to interact with
Themes via GraphQL.

## Queries

Query all themes on the site:

<GraphiQL
  query="{
	themes {
    nodes {
      id
      author
      authorUri
      description
      name
      screenshot
      slug
      tags
      themeUri
      version
    }
  }
}"
/>

Query a specific theme by ID by replacing the ID below with an ID from the response above to query a specific theme:

<GraphiQL
  query="{
  theme(id: 1) {
    id
    author
    authorUri
    description
    name
    screenshot
    slug
    tags
    themeUri
    version
  }
}"
/>

## Mutations

Right now there are no Mutations related to Themes.

If anyone feels that adding mutations for themes, such as changing the active theme, installing new
themes, or deleting themes should be added to WPGraphQL,
[open an issue](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues) and let's discuss.
