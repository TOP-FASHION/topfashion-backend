Plugins are a core tenant in every WordPress site. WPGraphQL currrently provides a plugins query to get a list of all site plugins and a plugin query to query a specific plugin by it's ID.

### Queries

<GraphiQL
  query="{
  plugins {
    nodes {
      id
      authorUri
      pluginUri
      description
      version
      author
    }
  }
}"
/>

<GraphiQL
  query="{
  plugin(id: 1) {
    id
    authorUri
    pluginUri
    description
    version
    author
  }
}"
/>

The plugin queries and mutations are still a work in progress, check out github for more information on where these features stand:
