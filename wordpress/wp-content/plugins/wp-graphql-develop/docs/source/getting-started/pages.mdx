Pages are a core WordPress Post Type and are core to the WPGraphQL Schema. On this page, we'll take
a look at various ways to interact with Pages using WPGraphQL.

</Note>

## Queries

WPGraphQL comes with RootQuery fields built-in to query Page data. You can query for lists of pages,
or an individual page. Below, we'll look at some common examples for querying for Pages.

### List of Pages

In this example, we query a list of Page nodes. By default, WPGraphQL will return 10 items.

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES {
      pages {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
/>

<Note title="What's up with edges and nodes?" type="info">
One of the first things you may ask when you see this is: <strong><em>"What in the world are
'edges' and 'nodes'?"</em></strong>.

We've written up a guide on what they are and why WPGraphQL makes use of this shape of data
throughout.

### Hierarchical Post Types

Pages are a Hierarchical Post Type in WordPress, which means they can have parents and children.

By default, querying for pages returns just the top level pages, and you can get the children by using
the `childPages` field, like so:

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES {
      pages {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
            childPages {
              nodes {
                id
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
/>

There are other fields for hierarchical post types, such as `parent` and `ancestors`.

### Arguments

In many cases, exactly 10 pages won't be what you need for your application. So we can use arguments
on the `pages` field to declare how many items we want.

Here we're using the `first` argument to declare that we want the first 5 pages.

<Note title="Using Variables with Arguments" type="info">
  We pass the number as a variable so that our query can be dynamic without
  changing the actual query string.{' '}
  <a href="/docs/getting-started/intro-to-graphql/">
    Learn more about using variables
  </a>
  .
</Note>

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES ($first: Int) {
      pages( first: $first ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    first: 5,
  }}
/>

You can adjust the number of items as well. Here we'll ask for just 1 Page:

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGE ($first: Int) {
      pages( first: $first ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    first: 1,
  }}
/>

### whereArgs

Page connections can be further filtered by using `whereArgs`.

The args available are largely similar to what's available (and end up mapping to) to the underlying
[WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query). We'll look at a few quick examples,
but it's probably best for you to spend some time exploring the Schema Docs to see what options are
available.

Also, keep in mind that the _entire_ WPGraphQL Schema is filterable should you need to extend the
Schema and provide custom arguments for your applications needs.

- **Here's an example of using the `where` argument to get a page with a specific title**

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_POSTS($first: Int $where:RootQueryToPageConnectionWhereArgs!) {
      pages(first: $first, where: $where) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  withDocs={true}
  variables={{
    first: 1,
    where: {
      title: 'Community',
    },
  }}
/>

### Pagination

When querying a list of nodes (Posts), it's common to need to paginate to fetch more items. The
Schema exposes some helpful fields we can ask for to know if there are more items to fetch.

Fields that are helpful for knowing if there are more items to paginate:

- **pageInfo.hasNextPage:** Whether there are more items going forward
- **pageInfo.hasPreviousPage:** Whether there are more items going backward
- **pageInfo.endCursor:** The cursor for the last item in the list
- **pageInfo.startCursor:** The cursor for the first item in the list

The arguments used for pagination are:

- **first:** The number of items to fetch. To be used along with `after` for forward pagination.
- **after:** The cursor to reference where to fetch from. To be used along with `first` for forward
  pagination.
- **last:** The number of items to fetch. To be used along with `before` for backward pagination.
- **before:** The cursor to reference where to fetch from. To be used along with `last` for backward
  pagination.

#### pageInfo

Here is an example of asking for `pageInfo` fields to see if there are more items in the list of
data.

You can see that we ask for the field `pageInfo`, and on that we ask for `hasNextPage` and
`endCursor`.

The `hasNextPage` field will be either `true` or `false`, and the `endCursor` will be an opaque
string that acts as a reference to the last node returned in the query.

The cursor can then be used as an argument in a follow-up query, to ask for pages `after` that point
in the dataset.

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES {
      pages {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
/>

#### first

We can use the `first` argument to declare how many items we want from the "front" of the dataset.
In this case, we're telling WPGraphQL we want the first 5 most recent pages.

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES($first: Int $after: String) {
      pages(first: $first after: $after) {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    first: 5,
    after: null,
  }}
/>

In the response, we see that `hasNextPage` responds with `true`, meaning there are more pages, and
we can use the `endCursor` to ask for the pages `after` the last item in this list.

#### after

The `after` argument is to be used in conjunction with the `first` argument for pagination purposes.

When querying for a list of pages, it's common to need to paginate. When we ask for the first `10`
pages, there's a good chance we'll want to follow-up and ask for the _first_ `10` pages _after_ the
final post in that list.

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES($first: Int $after: String) {
      pages(first: $first after: $after) {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    first: 5,
    after: 'YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjI=',
  }}
/>

#### last

We can use the `last` argument to declare how many items we want from the "back" of the dataset. In
this case, we're telling WPGraphQL we want the last 5 (oldest) pages.

At the bottom of the list will be the oldest item in the dataset. The top item in the list will be
the newest of the 5 displayed (because we're going backward here).

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES($last: Int $before: String){
      pages(last: $last before: $before) {
        pageInfo {
          hasPreviousPage
          startCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    last: 5,
    before: null,
  }}
/>

So, we can see that `hasPreviousPage` is set to true, which means we have more items `before` this.

We can take the `startCursor` and use that as the value of our next query as our `before` value.

#### before

Here, we take the `startCursor` from our previous query, and use it as the value for our `before`
input.

So, what we're saying is that we want `5` more items before the `startCursor` in our previous query.

As long as `hasPreviousPage` returns true, that means we have more data that we can paginate through.

<GraphiQL
  query="
    query GET_PAGES($last: Int $before: String) {
      pages(last: $last before: $before) {
        pageInfo {
          hasPreviousPage
          startCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    "
  variables={{
    last: 5,
    before: 'YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjQyNw==',
  }}
/>

### Page

If we know the ID of a Page, we can query for the page individually like so:

<GraphiQL
  query="
  query GET_PAGE( $id: ID! ) {
    page( id: $id ) {
      id
      pageId
      title
      date
      uri
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    id: 'cGFnZTo1Mg==',
  }}
/>

### PageBy

Sometimes you need to query an individual Page, but you don't have the ID. There are a few other
ways to get an individual Page, but using the `pageBy` query.

**Here's an example of getting a page by it's URI.**

<GraphiQL
  query="
  query GET_PAGE_BY_URI( $uri: String ) {
    pageBy( uri: $uri ) {
      id
      pageId
      title
      date
      uri
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    uri: 'community',
  }}
/>

**Here's an example of getting a page by it's database ID.**

<GraphiQL
  query="
  query GET_PAGE( $pageId: Int ) {
    pageBy( pageId: $pageId ) {
      id
      pageId
      title
      date
      uri
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    pageId: 52,
  }}
/>

## Mutations

In this section, we'll look at various ways to mutate Pages.

<Note title="Mutations and Auth" type="info">
WPGraphQL respects user capabilities when mutating data, so _most_ mutations in WPGraphQL require
requests to be Authenticated, and the user making the request must have proper capabilities to mutate
the data. Check out the <a href="/docs/guides/authentication-and-authorization">Authentication
and Authorization Guide</a> to learn more.

The demos below are public requests and will not actually mutate data, but you can get an idea of how
to compose mutations by looking at the examples.

</Note>

### Create Page

This is an example of a mutation to create a Page.

There are two required input fields to create a page, `clientMutationId` and `title`.

Here you can see that we define our input variable to be of the type `CreatePageInput!`.

By defining our input in this way, it allows for flexibility for the input variables. Whatever we
input will validate against the shape of the `CreatePageInput!` Type in the Schema. This means any
of the `nonNull` input fields will need to be required, but any of the other fields are optional,
but if included, still need to be of the specified Type defined in the Schema.

<GraphiQL
  query="
  mutation CREATE_PAGE( $input:CreatePageInput! ){
    createPage( input: $input ) {
      page {
        id
        title
        date
        slug
      }
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    input: {
      clientMutationId: 'CreatePage',
      title: 'New Page Title',
    },
  }}
/>

### Update Page

Below is an example mutation to update a page. For this, we _must_ know the ID of the Post.

<GraphiQL
  query="
  mutation UPDATE_Page( $input:UpdatePageInput! ){
    updatePage( input: $input ) {
      page {
        id
        title
        date
        slug
      }
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    input: {
      clientMutationId: 'UpdatePage',
      id: 'cGFnZTo1Mg==',
      title: 'New Title for the Page',
    },
  }}
/>

### Delete Page

Below is an example mutation to delete a page. For this, we _must_ know the ID of the Page.

<GraphiQL
  query="
  mutation DELETE_PAGE($input: DeletePageInput!) {
    deletePage(input: $input) {
      deletedId
      page {
        id
      }
    }
  }
  "
  variables={{
    input: {
      clientMutationId: 'DELETE_PAGE',
      id: 'cGFnZTo1Mg==',
    },
  }}
/>
