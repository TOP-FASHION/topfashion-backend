## About the plugin

This extension provides GraphQL mutations to login to WordPress, and in response you can ask for
the user and `authToken` and `refreshToken`.

The `authToken` can be used in the Headers of subsequent requests as a way of identifying the user
making the request. The `refreshToken` can be used when the `authToken` is expired and needs to
be refreshed.
