## Notifications of breaking changes

The best place to keep updated with breaking changes is in the release notes on Github for each release.

## Backward compatibility

While we try and maintain backward compatibility as much as we can, it's not always possible nor does
it always make sense.

Because of the nature of the Typed Schema that GraphQL revolves around, when a Field or Type in the
Schema changes, it _can_ sometimes lead to breaking changes for applications consuming the API.
