Debugging GraphQL can be intimidating. Because GraphQL provides a single entry point to all kinds
of data, it’s hard to know exactly how to begin debugging, as it seems like the kind of thing where
either everything is working or nothing is working.

Below are some tips to help with debugging.

## GraphQL Debug

When debugging WPGraphQL, in your wp-config.php you can add the following
`define( 'GRAPHQL_DEBUG', true );` and in some cases you will get more helpful debug messages
returned with the response to your GraphQL requests.

## WPGraphiQL IDE

One of the best ways to debug your WPGraphQL API (for now) is by using the [WPGraphiQL IDE](https://wpgraphql.wpengine.com/docs/extensions/wpgraphiql/)
and the network tab in your browser (I prefer Chrome).

<Note>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Any time you register new fields, or modify your Schema
  in any way, it’s best to refresh the WPGraphiQL page in your WordPress
  dashboard to ensure your Schema is fresh with any changes.
</Note>

Below are some situations you may come across and some tips on how to debug them.

### Internal Server Error / Schema Won’t Load in GraphiQL

If you see an error that says "Internal Server Error" in the GraphQL response, this means something
occurred during execution that caused an error. Not all errors are intended for public viewing as they
can expose sensitive details about the system. To expose the errors, you can (https://docs.wpgraphql.com/guides/debugging/#graphql-debug)[enable GRAPHQL_DEBUG]:

One common reason for seeing the `Internal Server Error` response is when a Field or Type has been
registered incorrectly.

For example, when registering a Field, a Type is required as part of the config. If a Type is not
declared when registering a Field, an `Internal Server Error` will be thrown.

#### Invalid Field

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function() {
  register_graphql_field( 'Post', 'invalidField', [
    'description' => __( 'Invalid field with no Type', 'your-textdomain' ),
  ] );
});
```

#### Valid Field

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function() {
  register_graphql_field( 'Post', 'validField', [
    'type' => 'String',
    'description' => __( 'Valid field with a Type defined', 'your-textdomain' ),
  ] );
});
```

## WPGraphQL Insights

If you’re trying to debug performance issues and reduce the number of queries happening behind the
scenes, we recommend activating the [WPGraphQL Insights](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-insights)
plugin. With this plugin active, there will be a Query Log returned with the GraphQL response which
can help identify potential performance problems or other issues.

WPGraphQL Insights also returns trace information about each resolver so you can determine which
resolvers are the slowest, which enables you to pinpoint bottlenecks.

<Note>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The trace data returned by WPGraphQL Insights is
  compatible with the trace tracking provided by{' '}
  <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/engine/">Apollo Engine</a>.
</Note>

## Resolver not executing properly

If you’re experiencing a field resolving differently then expected, one way to debug would be to
`var_dump()` within the resolver, and inspect with WPGraphiQL and your network tab.

For example:

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function() {
  register_graphql_field( 'RootQuery', 'debugField', [
    'type' => 'String',
    'description' => __( 'Field registered to demonstrate debugging', 'wp-graphql' ),
    'resolve' => function( $root, $args, $context, $info ) {
      var_dump( $root );
      var_dump( $args );
      var_dump( $context );
      var_dump( $info );
      die();
    }
  ] );
} );
```

**Here's a GIF showing how to use the Network tab to inspect the `var_dump()` output:**
